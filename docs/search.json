    "section": "Calculating LST",
    "text": "Calculating LST\nCalculating LST can be straightforward in principle, using Band 10 alone of Landsat 8 data. However, this will not account for surface emissivity. Thus, for this study, an adjusted LST is calculated. The first step is to convert the Digital Numbers \\(DN\\) in the Band 10 layer to Top of Atmosphere Spectral Radiance \\(L_\\lambda\\) values. This process uses input units found the images metadata/MLT file. These values are the RADIANCE_MULT_BAND_10 \\(M_L\\) and the RADIANCE_ADD_BAND_10 \\(\\text{A}_L\\).\nPutting these together into a formula is as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{L}_\\lambda = \\text{M}_L · \\text{DN} + \\text{A}_L\n\\]\n\n# define metadata values\nmult_b10 = 3.8e-04\nadd_b10 = 0.1\n\n# calc and plot\nl = (mult_b10 * b10 + add_b10)\n\nplot_raster_with_label(l, expression(Spectral~Radiance~(L[lambda])))\n\n\n\n\nThe second step is “Conversion of Radiance to At-Sensor Temperature” (Karyati et al. 2022). This This converts the Spectral Radiance into temperature values or Brightness Temperature \\(BT\\) in Kelvin. This process requires two constants related to Landsat 8 Band 10’s specific thermal conversion constants found again in the metadata file. These are \\(K1\\)and \\(K2\\).\nPutting this together into a formula is as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{BT} = \\frac{\\text{K2}}{ln(\\frac{\\text{K1}}{\\text{L}_\\lambda} + 1)}\n\\]\n\n# add effective wavelength of landsat b10\nk1 = 799.0284\nk2 = 1329.2405\n\n# calc and plot\nbt = (k2 / log(k1 / l + 1))\n\nplot_raster_with_label(bt, expression(Brightness~Temp~(BT))) \n\n\n\n\nThe above metric alone could be used for study of heat distribution, however it does not account for the variation caused by surface level emissivity. Emissivity denotes how much infrared a surface will absorb or reflect, ranging from a mirror to a perfect black surface. The values of emissivity range from 0 to 1 respectively. NDVI is used to determine emissivity, through the fractional vegetation factor \\(\\text{P}_v\\). This value is specific to the region being studied.\nThe formula for calculating fractional vegetation factor is as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{P}_v = (\\frac{\\text{NDVI}-\\text{NDVI}_\\min}{\\text{NDVI}_\\max - \\text{NDVI}_\\min})^2\n\\]\n\n# calc and plot vegetation factor\npv = ((ndvi - cellStats(ndvi, min)) / (cellStats(ndvi, max) - cellStats(ndvi, min)))^2\n\nplot_raster_with_label(pv, expression(Fractional~Vegetation~Factor~(P[v])))\n\n\n\n\nFrom this the surface emissivity can be calculated. This uses two constants relating to the relative emissivity of soil \\(\\epsilon\\text{s}\\lambda\\) and the emissivity of vegetation \\(\\epsilon\\text{v}\\lambda\\), as well as one surface roughness \\(\\text{C}\\lambda\\) metric of 0.005\nThe formula for estimating emissivity \\(\\epsilon\\lambda\\) is thus as follows:\n\\[\n\\epsilon\\lambda = \\epsilon\\text{v}\\lambda + \\epsilon\\text{s}\\lambda  · (1 - \\text{P}_v) + \\text{C}\\lambda\n\\]\n\n# soil emissivity\nes = 0.964\n\n# veg emissivity\nev = 0.984\n\n# calc and plot emissivity\ne =  ev * pv + es * (1 - pv) + 0.005\n\nplot_raster_with_label(e, expression(Emissivity~(epsilon*lambda)))\n\n\n\n\nNow most of the building blocks are in place to calculate the adjusted LST. This requires a correction constant \\(\\rho\\) that incorporates the Speed of Light \\(c\\), Planck’s constant \\(h\\), and Boltzmann’s constant \\(\\sigma\\).\nThe formula for this is as follows:\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{c·h}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\n# speed of light\nc = 2.997925e8 \n\n# planck's constant\nh = 6.626070e-34\n\n# boltzmann's constant\nsigma = 1.380649e-23\n\n# calc and output correction constant/rho \nrho = c * h / sigma\nrho\n\n[1] 0.01438777\n\n\nWith these building blocks, plus the wavelength of the emitted radiance for Landsat 8 \\(\\lambda\\), the adjusted LST \\(\\text{T}s\\) can be determined using the following formula (converting from Kelvin to Celcius:\n\\[\n\\text{T}_s = \\frac{\\text{BT}}{1 + (\\frac{\\lambda\\text{BT}}{\\rho} · ln(\\epsilon\\lambda))} - 273.15\n\\]\n\n# wavelength\nwl = 10.895e-6\n\n# calc and plot\nts = bt / (1 + (wl * bt /  1.4388e-2) * log(e)) - 273.15\n\nplot_raster_with_label(ts, expression(Land~Surface~Temperature~(T[s])))"
