## Introduction

Welcome/Bienvenido to the central repository for my thesis project, which casts a spotlight on the intersection of surface temperatures, environmental injustice, and tourism along the Southern Gran Canaria coastline. Focusing on the localities of Maspalomas and Playa del Ingl√©s and using remote sensing data from 2023, this project queries how these mass tourism destinations are affected by and contribute to climate-related disparities.

This platform serves as a comprehensive archive of the data analysis undertaken for project. Much of this is completed using R and Python, working within a GIS framework for these languages. Through innovative methodologies, this project operationalises a variety of remote sensing data sources such as the LandSat 8 sattellite and the Sentinel 2 unit to explore the distribution of surface temperatures on a micro-climate scale, juxtaposing these findings against the backdrop of local environmental justice and urban inequality concerns.
